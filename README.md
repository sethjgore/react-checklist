Hello Sam + Company,

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to do this test. It took me about 2.5 hours on and off Thursday and Friday. 

I use Meteor + Reacft to manage prototypes faster. Like you mentioned, I'm not going to elaborate much on the environment. I'm open to using any of the tools you mentioned, Meteor just comes to me naturally. 

#Installation Instructions

1) Install meteor on your system by using this command `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh` 

2) Clone this project

3) run `meteor` in the project root

4) Enjoy

#Additional Features

1) Add as Saved Item: You can save some of the list so you don't have to write them down again the next Tuesday
2) Clear the unsaved
3) Clear the entire list

#Features that could be useful
1) As you can see, I put 'Natasha' in the "who" button in each item. It would be useful to be able to assign roomates to items
2) Filter the list by roomate
3) a mailto: link that leads you to a new email CCing everybody with the list ordered by roomate
4) The (delete CHECKED) could be (clear CHECKED) instead, clearing the state rather than deleting the item. You can then delete them with (DELETE ALL) or (DELETE UNSAVED). This would give the user more flexibility. 

I would love to work on these extra "useful" features but I'm respective of the time limit.
